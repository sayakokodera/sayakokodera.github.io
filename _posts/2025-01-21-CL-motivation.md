## Intro: _"Is my problem indeed reliably solvable?"_


## Body: 4 benefits of following this blog series
#### (1) This is a common situation in (exploratory) data analysis

#### (2) Goal 1: verify if a problem is reliablly solvable in the given format

#### (3) Goal 2: understand what we can do to make a problem solvable, if it is not solvable in the present format

#### How: Causal Framework helps, but what is it? 

#### (4) I will go thorough real-world data


## Summary: what and why
#### What is this blog series about: deal with a common situation of "solve an inference problem with bunch of data" 

#### Two main goals of this series
1. Discuss approaches and tools to verify if a problem is reliablly solvable in the given format
2. Explore what we can do to make a problem solvable, if it turns out to be unsolvable  
   (2a) Systematic approach for design of experiment  
   (2b) Data-driven tools based on suitable assumptions
